/* Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node
to be deleted directly.

It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
*/


Solution :-


class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {                                 // The node to be deleted is passed in the function deleteNode() and NOT the head node.
        ListNode *p=node;
        while(node->next)
        {
            node->val=node->next->val;
            node=node->next;
        }
        while(p->next!=node)
        {
            p=p->next;
        }
        p->next=NULL;
    }
};
